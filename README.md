# Objective:
Demonstrate proficiency in utilizing iterative functions SUMX and AVERAGEX.
➡️  Given the Sales transactions Dataset : (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ymOBwbTLXF4tAM_Lqn9dClIlLmXrEY-3/view) 

You are tasked with mastering the use of iterative functions SUMX and AVERAGEX to analyze sales performance and product categories in the retail dataset and to determine:

Total sales amount for each product category. using SUMX
The average sales amount for each product category using the AVERAGEX function.
Total Customer Spend by Customer

Instructions

Total Sales Amount by Product Category (Using SUMX):

Create a measure named "Total Sales Amount" using the SUMX function to calculate the sales amount for each transaction.
Group the sales amounts by product category to determine the total sales amount for each category.
Ensure that the measure is correctly associated with the product categories table to access category information.
Average Sales Amount by Product Category (Using AVERAGEX):

Create a measure named "Average Sales Amount" using the AVERAGEX function to calculate the average sales amount for each product category.
Iterate over each transaction related to a particular category, computing the sales amount dynamically.
Determine the average sales amount for each product category, providing insights into the sales performance across categories.
Total Customer Spend by Customer:

Create a measure named "Total Orders Cost" to compute the total cost for each order.
Use the SUMX function to iterate over each transaction and calculate the total cost for each order.
Group the total order costs by customer to determine the total amount of money spent by each customer.
Ensure proper relationship establishment between the sales transactions table and the customers table to access customer information.
